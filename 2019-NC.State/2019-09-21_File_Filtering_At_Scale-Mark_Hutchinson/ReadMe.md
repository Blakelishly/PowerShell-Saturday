# File Filtering at Scale
#### Performance Analysis of I/O-bound problems in Powershell environments

# Notes
Due to time constraints, I did not show
__New User_20190913_143028.note__ during the PS Saturday presentation. I am also excluding it from the
post-event posted content.

The PowerPoint notes contain references to the extra material and how it was to be presented, such as "show in ISE".

The answers to the first slide quiz are:
* "Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan"
* "Waiting for Godot"
